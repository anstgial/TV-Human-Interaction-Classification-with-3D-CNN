# This project was delivered as my Master Thesis project for MSc in Data Science & Society at Tilburg University.

A comparison was completed between two different 3D CNN architectures, with and without data augmentation, to see if one can achieve equal or better classification performance compared to past studies.

The code was implemented at Google Colab setup and Keras and Tensorflow was used to create the 3D Convolutional Neural Network. The dataset was provided by the Oxford University and It can be found in the link below:

There were many limitations for this challenge, like the size of the dataset and limited computational power to conduct the experiments in full capacity. However, it is a good indication of the capabilities of 3D CNN in this particular problem.
