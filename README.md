# This project was delivered as my Master Thesis project for the master degree in Data Science & Society from Tilburg University.

A comparison was completed between two different 3D CNN architectures, with and without data augmentation, to see if one can achieve equal or better classification performance compared to past studies.

The code was implemented at Google Colab setup and Keras and Tensorflow was used to create the 3D Convolutional Neural Network. The dataset was provided by the Oxford University and It can be found in the link below:
